🕵️ Project description

Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets: In this project, we build a Machine Learning model that can predict which tweets are about a real disaster and which are not. The project topic is based around a Kaggle competition. 

🗄 Data

In the data file, you can find the training data which we use for training our model and the test data which we use to calculate the accuracy of our model. The sample data submission is the format in which we can submit a model.

💻Our results 

Week 1: First submission without any data cleaning: accuracy of the model = 0.79

Week 2: Several submissions, best one: accuracy of the model = 0.817

Modifications: Cross-validation in classifier and data cleaning

Week 3: on going
