🕵️ Project description

Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets: In this project, we build a Machine Learning model that can predict which tweets are about a real disaster and which are not. The project topic is based around a Kaggle competition. Have you ever wondered if the news were true or not? It is what we are trying to do with our prediction model. Given a set of tweets, we are trying to predict if the messages in the tweets are true or not. We will try to build a model with the best possible accuracy with the data provided.

🗄 Data

In the data file, you can find the training data which we use for training our model and the test data which we use to calculate the accuracy of our model. The sample data submission is the format in which we can submit a model.

🖋 Summary of the weeks

In these files, you can find and follow the progress of our work through the weeks in the summary slide.

💻Our results 

Week 1: First submission without any data cleaning: accuracy of the model = 0.79

Week 2: Several submissions, the best one: accuracy of the model = 0.817

Modifications: Cross-validation in classifier and data cleaning

Week 3: on going
